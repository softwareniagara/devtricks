# DevTricks

This repository contains a list of all the [talks](talks.md) that have been given during DevTricks. Please do not hesitate to send a pull request if you would like to make a contribution.

We line-up a few developers for each event to teach the programming languages, frameworks, tools and tips that make them productive. The audience has an opportunity to ask questions after each lesson. In fact, the audience even has a chance to join in. The floor is opened to ad hoc presentations at the end of the evening.

Join us on the second monday of each month at [Cowork Niagara](http://coworkniagara.com/).
