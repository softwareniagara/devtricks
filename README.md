# DevTricks

This repository contains a list of all the [talks](talks.md) that have been
given during DevTricks. Please do not hesitate to send a pull request if you
would like to make a contribution.

We line-up a few developers for each event to teach the programming languages,
frameworks, tools and tips that make them productive. The audience has an
opportunity to ask questions after each lesson. In fact, the audience even has
a chance to join in. The floor is opened to ad hoc presentations at the end of
the evening.

You can usually catch a DevTricks on the second monday of each month, coordinated
through the [Software Niagara Forum](http://forum.softwarenigara.com/).
